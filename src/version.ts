/**
 * Single version-identity seam (F19 update pathway).
 *
 * One place owns "what version am I, what package am I, what npm endpoint do I
 * check". Every other module imports from here rather than re-typing a literal.
 * Two hard-won lessons from prior-art update mechanisms are baked in:
 *
 *  - The **package name is a code constant**, never an LLM/runtime free choice.
 *    A model-driven update path that "decides" the npm name at execution time
 *    mistypes it (`@stz/cli`, `slice-tournament`, a typosquat) and queries the
 *    wrong package. Pinning it here closes that gap.
 *  - The **CLI version is read from package.json**, never hardcoded into a `.ts`
 *    string, so a release bump can never leave the reported version stale.
 *
 * `SCHEMA_VERSION` is independent of the package version: it tracks the shape of
 * the on-disk `.stz/` taxonomy and only bumps when the tier layout changes, so
 * `stz migrate` knows whether an existing project tree needs additive upgrade.
