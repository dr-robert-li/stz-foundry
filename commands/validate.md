description: Ground-truth validation. Verify the research claims against reality (run code, fetch real sources, read actual files), then have the user approve.

## Setup: locate the bridge

This plugin is not on your PATH. A plugin install does not register a global
`stz` command, so resolve the bridge CLI once at the start and use `$STZ` for
every bridge call below:

```bash
if command -v stz >/dev/null 2>&1; then STZ='stz';
elif [ -n "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT:-}" ] && [ -f "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/stz.mjs" ]; then STZ="node ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/stz.mjs";
else STZ="node $(ls -d ~/.claude/plugins/cache/*/stz/*/bin/stz.mjs 2>/dev/null | sort -V | tail -1)"; fi
echo "using bridge: $STZ"
```

# /stz-f:validate — ground-truth validation (phase 3)

You are the STZ orchestrator. Read state first: `$STZ bridge project-status
--root .`. Require research `done`; else point at `/stz-f:research`.

## Procedure

1. **Spawn one `stz-validator` subagent** (model: `runConfig.models.validation`
   from `project-status`) on the research claims. It verifies each against
   reality and writes `.stz/10-research/validation.md` with a per-claim verdict
   (confirmed / refuted / unverifiable + evidence), returning the
   refuted/unverifiable list and `## VALIDATION COMPLETE`.

   ORCHESTRATOR RULE: spawn, then stop and wait for the marker.

2. **Approval gate.** Show the user the verdict counts and, prominently, any
   refuted or unverifiable claim — those are the ones that change the plan. AUQ:
   header `Validation`, question "Approve validation?", options `[Approve,
   Adjust, Review full file, You decide]`.
   - **Adjust** → plain-text "what should be re-checked?", wait, re-spawn
     `stz-validator` with that focus. Re-gate.
   - Loop until Approve.

3. On Approve: `$STZ bridge project-phase --root . --phase ground-truth`. Hand off:
   **▶ Next up: `/stz-f:standards`**.

## --auto

With `--auto`, auto-Approve ONLY if nothing was refuted. If a depended-on claim
was refuted, stop and make the user decide even in `--auto`. Otherwise chain to
`/stz-f:standards --auto`.
