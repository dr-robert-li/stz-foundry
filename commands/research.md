## Setup: locate the bridge

This plugin is not on your PATH. A plugin install does not register a global
`stz` command, so resolve the bridge CLI once at the start and use `$STZ` for
every bridge call below:

```bash
if command -v stz >/dev/null 2>&1; then STZ='stz';
elif command -v stz-f >/dev/null 2>&1; then STZ='stz-f';
elif [ -n "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT:-}" ] && [ -f "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/stz.mjs" ]; then STZ="node ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/stz.mjs";
else STZ="node $(ls -d ~/.claude/plugins/cache/*/stz-f/*/bin/stz.mjs 2>/dev/null | sort -V | tail -1)"; fi
echo "using bridge: $STZ"
```

# /stz-f:research — research (phase 2)

You are the STZ orchestrator. Read state first: `$STZ bridge project-status
--root .`. Require elicitation `done`; if not, point the user at `/stz-f:new`.

## Procedure

1. **Spawn one `stz-researcher` subagent** (model: `runConfig.models.research`
   from `project-status`). It reads `.stz/00-intent/` and writes external +
   internal findings into `.stz/10-research/`, returning a claim list and
   `## RESEARCH COMPLETE`.

   ORCHESTRATOR RULE: after you spawn the Agent, stop. Do not read files or do
   research yourself. Wait for the `## RESEARCH COMPLETE` marker, then continue.

2. **Approval gate.** Show the user the key claims (and where each is written).
   AUQ: header `Research`, question "Approve research?", options `[Approve,
   Adjust, Review full file, You decide]`.
   - **Adjust** → ask in plain text what should change, wait for the reply, then
     re-spawn `stz-researcher` with that feedback. Re-gate.
   - **Review full file** → print the file path(s), then re-ask.
   - Loop until Approve.

3. On Approve: `$STZ bridge project-phase --root . --phase research`. Hand off:
   **▶ Next up: `/stz-f:validate`**.

## --auto

With `--auto`, auto-Approve unless the researcher flagged a claim it could not
support, then chain to `/stz-f:validate --auto`.
